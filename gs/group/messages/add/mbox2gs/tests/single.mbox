So you see Antonio, why worry about one little core dump, eh? In
reality all core dumps happen at the same instant, so the core
dump you will have tomorrow, why, it already happened. You see,
it's just a little universal recursive joke which threads our
lives through the infinite potential of the instant. So go to
sleep, Antonio, your thread could break any moment and cast you
out of the safe security of the instant into the dark void of
eternity, the anti-time. So go to sleep...
