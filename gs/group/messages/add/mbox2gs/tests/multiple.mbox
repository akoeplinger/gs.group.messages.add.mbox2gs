So you see Antonio, why worry about one little core dump, eh? In
reality all core dumps happen at the same instant, so the core
dump you will have tomorrow, why, it already happened. You see,
it's just a little universal recursive joke which threads our
lives through the infinite potential of the instant. So go to
sleep, Antonio, your thread could break any moment and cast you
out of the safe security of the instant into the dark void of
eternity, the anti-time. So go to sleep...

And all that the Lorax left here in this mess
was a small pile of rocks with the one word, "unless."
Whatever THAT meant, well, I just couldn't guess.
That was long, long ago, and each day since that day,
I've worried and worried and worried away.
Through the years as my buildings have fallen apart,
I've worried about it with all of my heart.

"BUT," says the Oncler, "now that you're here,
the word of the Lorax seems perfectly clear!
UNLESS someone like you cares a whole awful lot,
nothing is going to get better - it's not.
So... CATCH!" cries the Oncler.  He lets something fall.
"It's a truffula seed.  It's the last one of all!

"You're in charge of the last of the truffula seeds.
And truffula trees are what everyone needs.
Plant a new truffula -- treat it with care.
Give it clean water and feed it fresh air.
Grow a forest -- protect it from axes that hack.
Then the Lorax and all of his friends may come back!"
